# The Google Mirror API from JavaScript
A tiny example that shows you how to insert timeline cards into Glass from JavaScript using the [Google APIs Client Library for JavaScript](https://code.google.com/p/google-api-javascript-client/).

Most of the interesting stuff the Mirror API can do requires an Internet accessible URL for subscriptions, so in this example I focus entirely on inserting timeline cards.
